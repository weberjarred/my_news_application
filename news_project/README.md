# Project Documentation:

# [eCommerce] Project

# Django Project

This is a modular news application built with Python.

This application, built with Django, showcases CRUD capabilities,
a responsive design through Bootstrap, and a modular project structure,
and it employs unit testing following the AAA pattern. Every template incorporates
semantic HTML elements (header, section, article, footer) along with Bootstrap
classes to achieve a responsive and polished design.

Organised project structure extends to the eCommerce news application with a secure
RESTful API and also integrates Twitter’s API to tweet when news articles posted and published.

This Django-based News Web Application allows readers to view articles and
newsletters published by independent journalists and publishers.
It includes role-based authentication, article approval workflows
(with email and X (formerly Twitter) notifications), and a
RESTful API for third-party access.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Create 'django_projects' folder in file explorer.
   "C:\...\django_project_news" => project folder dir
2. Create a virtual environment - while in project folder dir
   Type: 'python -m venv myVenv' into vs code terminal
   2.1. Activate virtual environment
   Type: 'source myVenv/Scripts/activate' into vs code terminal, then
   Type: 'pip freeze' into the vs code term.
3. Install django - still while in project folder dir
   Type: 'pip install django' into the vs code terminal, then
   Type: 'pip freeze' into the vs code term.
4. Create a new django project and application
   4.1. Create a new django project:
   Type: 'django-admin startproject news_project' into vs code term, while still in proj. folder dir
   4.2. Change directory to proj ROOT dir
   Type: 'cd news_project' into vs code term
   4.3. Create a new Django application:
   Type: 'django-admin startapp newsApp' into vs code term
   Type: 'ls' into vs code term
5. Run initial database migrations to set up the database tables:
   Type: 'python manage.py migrate' into the vs code term
6. Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:
   Type: 'python manage.py createsuperuser' into the vs code term, then,
   Fill in: username, email (rrrr@rrrr.com), password (1234 --this is a fictitious password)
7. Start the Django development server:
   Type: 'python manage.py runserver' into the vs code term, then follow the http://... link in term
8. Create the necessary subfolders and modules where needed within the proj folder dir or proj root dir
9. Edit and populate the different modules and subfolders
10. Install flake8:
    Type: 'pip install flake8' into the vs code term and create and populate the .flake8 file.
11. Install Black:
    Type: 'pip install black' into the vs code term
12. Perform black and flake8 PEP 8 standards. >>> Don't use prettier on HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It causes app errors
13. Install MySQL on your local machine, define host, port, username, and password accordingly.
    Then, connect to your MySQL server.
14. Run Migrations:
    Open your terminal and execute the following commands in your project’s ROOT directory:

    'python manage.py migrate' into the vs code term
15. Restart Your Development Server:
    Type: 'python manage.py runserver' into the vs code term, then follow the http://... link in term
16. Use your application and check if it works.
17. Generate requirements.exe file:
    Type: 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' into vs code term, while in proj root dir.
18. Generate README.md file.
    NOTE: Perform migrations to ensure that any new changes are reflected in the database, and restart the development server to test your application.
19. Install djangorestframework:
    Type: 'pip install djangorestframework' into the vs code term, while still in the proj root dir.
20. Install requests:
    Type: 'pip install requests' into the vs code term, while still in the proj root dir.

    Open your terminal and execute the following commands in your project’s ROOT directory:
    Type: 'python manage.py makemigrations'
    'python manage.py migrate' into the vs code term
23. Perform application functionality tests:
24. Manual (Functional) Testing
    1.1. Basic Project Setup
    1.1.1. Activate your virtual environment and install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    1.1.2. Apply migrations and create a superuser:
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    1.1.3. Run the server:
    python manage.py runserver

1.2. Testing the Admin Site
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ → Log in using your superuser credentials → Create or view data (e.g., Publishers, Articles, CustomUser, etc.) → Verify that you can add/edit/delete records via the admin interface.
1.3. Testing Registration & Login
1.4. Testing Role-Based Access
1.5. Testing via Postman

24. Install Postman:
25. Test GET Endpoints: test the endpoint that lists all stores, set the method to GET within Postman.

26.4. If successful, you should receive a JSON response with the new store’s data and an HTTP status code of 201. 27. Run tests once again. i.e.
Type: 'python manage.py test' and 'python manage.py test --verbosity 2' into the vs code term.
