"""
This file contains a function to “post” a tweet using X's HTTP API.

For demonstration purposes, the function simply prints the tweet
content. In a real application, you would integrate with X's API
using the requests module.
"""

import requests


def post_tweet(article):
    """
    Post a tweet based on the given article's title.

    Args:
        article (object): An object representing the article.
            It is expected to have a 'title' attribute.

    Returns:
        None

    Example:
        article = Article(title="Breaking News: Python Takes Over the World")
        post_tweet(article)
        # Output: Tweet posted: New Article Published: Breaking News:
        # Python Takes Over the World
    """
    # Create tweet content based on the article title.
    tweet_content = f"New Article Published: {article.title}"
    # Here, you would normally send an HTTP POST request to X's API.
    # Example (commented out):
    # response = requests.post(
    #     'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets',
    #     headers=headers,
    #     json={'text': tweet_content}
    # )
    # For demonstration, print the tweet content.
    print(f"Tweet posted: {tweet_content}")
